## Inside Innovation and Motivation of Testers

### Inside Innovation
__Cristiana Maria Gusanu (Expert IT Architect @ Nordea Markets)__

Are you a creative person? Do you spend a lot of time thinking about thinking? Do you believe the myth that says that only some people are creative? Or the one that says that you cannot be creative and an engineer at the same time? How does an innovative mind work?
These are some of the questions I am going to answer in my “Inside Innovation” talk. First you’ll find out what are the main characteristics of the innovative thinking. Then you’ll be guided step by step through every thinking stage required to produce innovative ideas. In the end we’ll talk about failure and how can we use it in the innovation process. I’ll be giving you lots of examples and I’ll be teaching you innovative thinking techniques.

The main takeaways of my talk are:
• Modelling the problem approach techniques and open up ways to change the classic problem solving approaches;
• Understanding the innovative thinking processes;
• Innovation thinking exercises with practical examples;
• How to use failure in the innovation process;
• How all the above apply in the software development and testing landscape;

### How to awake a motivation in Software Tester to love his job? And how to stimulate this motivation over the years? How to Motivate Your Software Tester?
__Petra Boušková (Test Coordinator @ TESENA S.R.O.)__

On a global scale this is a part of bigger problem which many companies are facing today, despite of its size or the field of business. I was systematic and persistent and have discussed this issue with Software Testers in various testing roles across multiple fields. I came up with methods of motivation which can be applied in any company’s environment. Methods which can help to boost energy in a team and lead to more proactive work approach. Methods which can provide easier and smoother process of hiring new Software Testers.
My presentation includes following points:
• Different approaches of pouring energy into Junior or Senior Tester.
• Method ‘Being a Tester – Who is tomorrow’s Lead‘
• Emphasizing the Benefits of Communication with Stakeholders, Business Department, Developers, Leads and Analytics.
• Using a modernized ‘Carrot and Stick’ Approach to Motivation in society nowadays.
• Finding an Individual motivation target for everyone and working with it.
