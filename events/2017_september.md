## A Planning Meeting You’ll Love

To kick-off the season, palinQA's longtime friend Gáspár Nagy is going to host a workshop on example mapping. This workshop-like event does not require to have a laptop with you. Liferay is kindly hosting us.
Before you pull a user story into development or testing, it’s crucial to have a conversation to clarify and confirm the acceptance criteria.
Some people do this during their backlog refinement or planning poker sessions. Other teams have a specific three amigos meeting, specification workshop or discovery workshop, or do it during sprint planning.
Whatever you call this conversation, many teams find it hard: it’s unstructured, it takes too long and gets boring. The result is they don’t do it regularly or consistently, or maybe they just give up on it entirely.
Example mapping is a simple, low-tech method for making this conversation short and powerfully productive. In this session we’ll show you how to apply this technique, with a fun and interactive workshop.
The topic is based on our new book: [“Discovery – Explore behavior using examples”](http://bddbooks.com/discovery).
