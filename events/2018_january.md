## Data Profiling & Contract Testing

### How important is data quality for Data Engineer?
__Manel Rhaiem (Data Engineer @ Secret Sauce Partners)__

Since I started my career with Secret Sauce Partners as a Data Engineer, I have learned the true meaning of data quality and how important it is to make a software system to provide accurate predictions with the data. The company I am working for is currently facing some data quality and data management issues as any other company working with big data. To identify and address those issues, we are performing data testing and validation checks in basically every step to make sure the flow of data processing maintains a good quality. Quality is never achieved by an accident; it’s always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and skillful execution; it represents the wise choices among many alternatives.
During my presentation, I would like to share with you how we are trying to solve quality issues with different tools, while we mainly use Python language.

### Consumer-driven contract testing
__Peter Czibik (Software Developer @ RisingStack)__

In the world of APIs making sure that we’re not breaking our clients code is the real challenge. As a fullstack software consultant working with growing microservice architectures I have to feel the pain of both the server and client work, I’d like to present a clean way to make sure everyone stays happy and things don’t break (or at least we know ahead of time if they are).
Attendees after the talk will be familiar with the concepts of contract testing and will get to know a small library called pact that can help integrating it into their current software development workflow.
