## TestBash taste under the hood of the Dojo

Happiness is best when it’s shared! With the blessing of Ministry of Testing, this palinQA event will allow you to watch two talks from TestBash conferences which are found only in the Dojo Pro of MoT.

These talks will be projected:
• Do Testers Need a Thick Skin? Or Should We Admit We’re Simply Human? (https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/do-testers-need-a-thick-skin-or-should-we-admit-we-re-simply-human-nicola-sedgwick) – Nicola Sedgwick in TestBash 2016
• How to Misuse 'Automation' for testing, fun and productivity (https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/how-to-misuse-automation-for-testing-fun-and-productivity-alan-richardson) - Alan Richardson in TestBash Netherlands 2017
